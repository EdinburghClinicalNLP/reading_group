# Bio-Clinical NLP Reading Group Resources

This Bio-Clinical NLP Reading Group is an additional reading group, existing together with the regular [Clinical NLP Group](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/clinical-natural-language-processing) meetings.
We meet every two weeks on Wednesday (Starting Nov 8th, 2023) from 5pm to 6pm in a booked room at Informatics Forum.
The Reading Group will mainly be a place for all of us, Bio/Clinical NLPers, to discuss in a relaxed setup.
The Reading Group can also be an opportunity for anyone to present their ongoing work and ask for feedback.
